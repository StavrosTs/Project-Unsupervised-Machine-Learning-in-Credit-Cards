Data Analysis in Spotify Dataframe 2017-2021

1. Cleaning Process
    - Explore the dataset.
    - The important emelents are 6, so i must breakdown the first column.
    - Then i must isolate the elements so i can use them for my analysis.
    - But first i must try clean my dataset and drop as little information as possible.
    - So important categories are separated by # and their length must be 6. I always check their length and         make adjustments.
    - When my lists of 6 elements are ready, i separate them and i transform them so they can be useful for my       analysis. Their indeces in lists are all the same so it's easy to breakdown the lists.
    - At last, i keep only the columns that i will need for analysis and i create a new column of lists which         consists of the genres of each song. It's necessary for analysis phase.
    - Let's proceed!
   
2. Analysis Process
    - I am creating necessary columns which i will need for analysis.
    - I need three different columns for year,month & day.
    - Genres & their subdivisions are too many, so i simplify them.
    - Then, i count each genre and i save my numbers in a dictionary.
    - I use the dictionary for my first graph & i find top 10 genres.
    - I isolate them & i use a plot area graph. It seems like the variety of genres decreases through time. 
      (It must consists of months between January-July because my dataset was extracted July 2021 & i want my       graph to be accurate)
    - I count total streams per year. (7 months for same reason!)
    - I check if total streams before & after covid are decreasing or increasing. (See the above warnings!)
    - I count total streams per month. (I exclude 2021 because it consists of 7 months)
    - I count total streams per year & month.
    - At last, i find the most popular artists & i check if the most popular artist sings the most popular           genre. Guess what he isn't.
    - Now it's time for you to see my presentation.
