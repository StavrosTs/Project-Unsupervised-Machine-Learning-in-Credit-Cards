2. Cleaning & Analysis 
    - First, we read the dataset in order to find empty rows or unnecessary columns that we should drop.
    - Then we visualized our data, so we could:
         i. Find highly correlated columns.
        ii. See the distribution of our data.
    - The steps we took & the changes we made:
         i. We created our own range of frequencies for better categorization.
        ii. We logged our data for a better normal distribution.
       iii. Reduced dimensions in order to remove noise.
      iiii. Found the most efficient number of clusters.
        iv. Named our clusters.

3. Presentation
    - Exported the necessary graphs for our presentation.
    - Thank you for reading!
