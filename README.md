2. Cleaning & Analysis 
    - First, we read the dataset in order to find empty rows or unnecessary columns that we should drop.
    - Then we visualized our data, so we could:
        - Find highly correlated columns.
        - See the distribution of our data.
    - The steps we took & the changes we made:
        - We created our own range of frequencies for better categorization.
        - We logged our data for a better normal distribution.
        - Reduced dimensions in order to remove noise.
        - Found the most efficient number of clusters.
        - Named our clusters.

3. Presentation
    - Exported the necessary graphs for our presentation.
    - Thank you for reading!
